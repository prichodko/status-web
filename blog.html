  Nimbus has released a production-ready version of its validator client,
  addressing a key demand from node operators and advanced users. The client is
  highly performant and requires low resources, allowing it to run on a range of
  devices <strong>—</strong> from embedded systems to enterprise servers.
</p>
<p>
  By default, the Nimbus consensus client's design allows validators to be run
  directly from the beacon node, simplifying validator setup. This makes it an
  ideal choice for solo-stakers, and select node operators that want to use the
  Nimbus beacon node. However, it made it difficult for operators to use Nimbus
  in their existing setups, which often feature one or more client beacon nodes
  interacting with multiple validator clients.
</p>
<p>
  For example, one node operator runs a Teku beacon node with Teku and LH
  validator clients. Another operator runs a Vouch-based setup with four
  different client beacon nodes and a Vouch validator client. This also includes
  node operators in the Rocket Pool network that run several mini-pools. Each
  operator has fine-tuned their setup for redundancy, performance and resource
  consistency. It was understandably challenging for these users to directly use
  the default Nimbus setup of an integrated beacon node and validator client,
  which would mean a completely different stack to maintain and manage.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/releases"
    >Release v22.11.0</a
  >
  allows users to run the Nimbus validator client independently with beacon
  nodes from other clients, giving operators greater flexibility and the ability
  to introduce Nimbus into their existing setups with minimal change. This
  configuration is ideal for operators running hundreds to thousands of
  validators.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, the new release includes improvements and fixes. For example,
  the beacon node is now compatible with validator clients taking advantage of
  the <code>/eth/v1/beacon/blinded_blocks</code> endpoint, and enables much
  faster loading of the validator keystore during startup.
</p>
<p>
  Nimbus's privacy characteristics, including its low public profile and support
  for publishing blocks to separate nodes (such that the validator cannot be
  matched to its IP address by listening to attestation traffic), make it an
  attractive choice for advanced users and node operators.
</p>
<p>
  The Nimbus team will continue to support and improve the standalone beacon
  node setup for individual users and hope to see more operators include the
  Nimbus validator client in their fleet to improve overall client diversity
  across the Ethereum network.

</blockquote>
<p>
  The Amazon-iRobot acquisition has prompted us all to consider (or reconsider,
  for many of us) a new dimension of privacy. We are so often concerned with—and
  building for the purposes of—online privacy, that we have been less focused on
  a different type of privacy invasion.
</p>
<p>
  Privacy in your own home is under attack. Unlike the privacy compromises
  required by many web2 services, however, this is privacy that can usually be
  maintained at virtually no cost. Virtually no cost—that is, unless you are
  already reliant upon smart appliances.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-smart-appliance">What is a smart appliance?</h2>
<p>
  If you have been anywhere on the internet since about 2014, you are probably
  familiar with some of the earliest general purpose smart appliances—for
  example, Amazon Echo/Alexa or Google’s Nest. Or perhaps you (or someone you
  know) have used more specialized products—some of which have been around much
  longer. Take, for example, the Roomba autonomous vacuum, which has been for
  sale for almost 20 years, or smart watches, or key chains, or doorbells, or
  light bulbs.
</p>
<p>
  Or the most ubiquitous smart “appliance” of all—a smart phone. Of course,
  privacy concerns regarding mobile phones are a well-covered topic, but they
  fit the wider theme of smart appliances creating avenues for abuse of consumer
  data and privacy.
</p>
<h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-the-big-deal">What’s the big deal?</h2>
<p>
  Take the
  <a href="https://about.irobot.com/Legal/Privacy-Policy">privacy policy</a> for
  the autonomous vacuum, Roomba. From this policy we may find that some Roomba
  models can “transmit data wirelessly to the Service . . . . stored in a
  deidentified state (separated from identifiable information).”
</p>
<p>
  It <em>should</em> be a comfort that the data is stored in a “deidentified
  state,” but by now we should all know that
  <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/privacy-risks-mobility-data-1207"
    >anonymous data</a
  >
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_re-identification">is often</a>
  <a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/anonymised-data-never-be-anonymous-enough-study-finds"
    >easily reidentified</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Roombas may collect “information about the robot's movement throughout the
  environment <strong>to create a location "map"</strong> of the Robot’s domain
  and
  <strong>the existence and type of objects (chair, desk, fridge etc.)</strong>
  or obstacles encountered” as well as “Wi-Fi signal strength in each location,”
  and “device data, such as MAC address, device type, device name, identifier,
  serial number, product code, network bandwidth usage, and device location
  within and near the home.”
</p>
<p>
  Roombas may also try to guess what various objects around your house/flat, or
  connected to your wi-fi are: “types of objects (detected using the camera on
  your Robot) along with a corresponding confidence factor for that object and
  its location, the location and confidence factor of Wi-Fi devices connected to
  your local network, and Wi-Fi heat maps.”
</p>
<p>
  It might seem silly to think that the little robot vacuum is doing all of
  this, but it’s not at all silly to think that iRobot, or Amazon, might now
  have the most detailed floor plans of your dwelling that have ever existed.
</p>
<p>
  Speaking of Amazon, we haven’t forgotten about the Ring debacle. Amazon’s Ring
  is a smart doorbell that enables you to see who’s at the door—just by checking
  your phone. It also records footage that Amazon might give to law enforcement,
  as they
  <a
    href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/07/amazon-finally-admits-giving-cops-ring-doorbell-data-without-user-consent/"
    >already have at least 11 times so far this year</a
  >.
</p>
<p>From <a href="https://ring.com/privacy-notice">Ring’s privacy policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  [We collect] Content (and related information) that is captured and recorded
  when using our products and services, such as
  <strong>video or audio recordings, live video or audio streams</strong>,
  images, comments, and data our products collect from their surrounding
  environment to perform their functions (such as motion, events, temperature
  and ambient light).
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis added)</p>
<p>
  Or consider the aforementioned Google Nest. Nest represents a suite of
  products, from smart speakers to thermostats to cameras and more.
</p>
<blockquote>
  We believe the best way to earn your trust is to keep you in control of your
  information. We only share personal information when you explicitly give
  permission. When you do give us this permission, we also let you know what
  personal info we’re sharing and why. And you can stop sharing your personal
  information at any time.<br /><a href="https://nest.com/privacy/"
    >https://nest.com/privacy/</a
  >
</blockquote>
<p>
  But are you really in control? Note that you have no say in terms of what data
  they <em>collect</em>, merely what they <em>share</em>.
</p>
<p>
  In fairness, Nest’s
  <a
    href="https://nest.com/legal/privacy-statement-for-nest-products-and-services/"
    >privacy policy</a
  >
  actually seems quite a bit less egregious than that of Amazon’s Ring, or
  Roomba (at least in the author’s estimation)—but there’s a not-so-small
  problem:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Note: If you use your Nest devices and services with a Google Account, then
  your data will be handled as described in the Google Privacy Policy
</blockquote>
<p>
  And we should all know that Google
  <a
    href="https://www.cnet.com/home/security/ring-google-and-the-police-what-to-know-about-emergency-requests-for-video-footage/"
    >does not have the greatest record</a
  >
  when it comes to consumer privacy.
</p>
<h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-the-solution">What’s the solution?</h2>
<p>
  Don’t use smart appliances! Or if you do, keep them disconnected from the
  internet. If you must use an internet-connected smart appliance, read their
  privacy policy, be aware of what sacrifices in terms of privacy or anonymity
  you are making for the sake of convenience, and keep in mind that they may
  still end up mishandling your data, or leaking it, or providing it to the
  government without your consent or a warrant.
</p>
<p>
  Not everyone values privacy to the extent that we do—we understand this, but
  it’s up to us (you too) to make sure that everyone understands the
  consequences of surrendering it. Talk to your friends and family about their
  smart appliances, if they have any. Don’t drown them in articles or arguments.
  Be persistent, not overbearing. Ask if they would allow a stranger, or a group
  of strangers, to sit in their home and listen to them in case they wanted to
  play a Spotify playlist, or place an Amazon order—or vacuum their house.
</p>
<p>
  To be utterly clear, we are not in the least opposed to technological
  advancement, automation, or even smart appliances themselves. We think
  autonomous vacuums, automatically adjusting lights, and voice-activated
  appliances are cool—really cool. But such tech offers unique opportunities for
  the exploitation of consumer privacy—and many companies are ravenously taking
  advantage of these opportunities.
</p>
<p>They are failing you.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>
  If you registered a stateofus.eth name in the Status app before October 31,
  2021, then you can collect $ENS as part of this voluntary redistribution.
  Check if you’re eligible and collect ENS tokens at
  <u
    ><a href="https://ens-collect.status.im/"
      >https://ens-collect.status.im</a
    ></u
  >. You can collect your tokens over a period of 3 months, between Tuesday July
  5th 15:00 UTC and Oct 5th 15:00 UTC.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  On Nov. 8th, 2021, Status was allocated 46,296.3 ENS tokens as a thank you for
  the early integration of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) into the Status
  ecosystem. In Status you can:
</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
<ul>
  <li>Register a stateofus.eth subdomain name</li>
  <li>Connect an existing ENS or stateofus.eth subdomain name to your chat</li>
  <li>Allow others to send messages to your ENS name</li>
  <li>Allow others to send tokens to your ENS name</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
<p>
  The $ENS allocation was part of an airdrop
  <a href="https://ens.mirror.xyz/cfvfKRpQSPtZJjPQOprWqEeqv2rytE7tQkxDg6ht7Oo"
    ><u>announced</u></a
  >
  by the ENS team on November 1st, 2021 as part of its transition into a DAO to
  govern the ENS protocol.
</p>
<p>
  The airdrop distributed tokens to <em>users</em>, i.e. addresses that had
  registered a .eth name, and <em>contributors</em>, i.e. individuals and
  organizations that contributed in significant ways to ENS over the prior four
  years; No tokens were distributed to users that had registered a subdomain,
  such as a stateofus.eth name (as the main purpose was to govern .eth).
</p>
<p>
  In this
  <a
    href="https://discuss.status.im/t/governance-discussion-re-distribution-of-ens-token-allocation/2344"
    ><u>discuss post</u></a
  >, @petty laid out reasons for $ENS allocated to Status, to be redistributed
  to those who registered a stateofus.eth name:
</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
<ul>
  <li>
    <em
      >The developers of features that incentivize the use of SNT should be
      rewarded commensurate to the growth of the feature. This is a fundamental
      idea behind development and reward in Web3.</em
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <em
      >The users of an incentivized feature (particularly early and earnest
      ones) should be rewarded for their contribution and engagement.</em
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <em
      >As ENS is primarily a public good, the distribution of its governance
      token should be maximally distributed across its users, thus our oversized
      allocation as an organization should not be wielded by only a few
      individuals.</em
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <em
      >ENS usernames in Status are fully owned by their registrants while their
      SNT is locked up in the smart contract. It can be argued that the
      allocation does not fully belong to the Status organization, but also to
      those that have used the username feature, as the airdrop did not include
      subdomain accounts. That argument is hinged upon whether not the ENS team
      feels it is the responsibility of the feature implementer to equally
      handle that distribution, as all subdomain use across ENS is not equal and
      outside the scope of the ENS team to decide.</em

    ><u>proposal</u></a
  >
  on how to manage redistribution was made and accepted with 99.99% of voting
  power. As a result of this proposal and efforts by @petty and @gravityblast,
  you can now collect $ENS, subject to Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<h2 id="am-i-eligible-to-collect-ens">Am I eligible to collect $ENS?</h2>
<p>
  If you registered at least one stateofus.eth name before October 31st, 2021,
  <strong>then</strong> <strong>you are eligible</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Note that if you registered a .eth before October 31st, 2021 you
  <em>were </em>eligible to collect $ENS through
  <a href="https://claim.ens.domains/"><u>https://claim.ens.domains/</u></a
  >. The airdrop finished on May 4th, 2022 and $ENS can no longer be claimed for
  .eth names. This was mentioned in the original discuss post.
</p>
<h4 id="how-much-do-i-get">How much do I get?</h4>
<p>
  The amount you receive is weighted by time. The longer you’ve held your
  stateofus.eth name, the more $ENS you’ll receive. If you’ve registered
  multiple names on a given address, the name that you’ve registered and held
  longest at any time up until Oct 31st counts. If you’ve registered names from
  different addresses, you can collect $ENS using each address. Having multiple
  names registered with a single address does not increase the amount.
</p>
<p>
  This logic follows

<p>
  In general an Ethereum client consists of two layers - the consensus layer and
  the execution layer.
</p>
<p>
  The consensus layer is responsible for the consensus, i.e. block validity, and
  fork choice rule. As it stands, on mainnet, we rely on PoW consensus. The
  Merge enables PoS consensus driven by the beacon chain.
</p>
<p>
  The execution-layer is responsible for transaction bundling, execution, and
  state management. During the merge this layer will be represented by modified
  pre-merge PoW clients (eg. geth, nethermind, besu, openethereum, turbogeth,
  etc).
</p>
<p>
  The key to a successful merge is getting these two layers to talk to each
  other: the plan right now is for them to interact via a one-way communication
  protocol, driven by the consensus layer (although this approach is not yet set
  in stone).
</p>
<blockquote>
  Note that if these layers are bundled into a single piece of software, then
  the UX of running a post-merge client becomes very similar to running a
  pre-merge PoW client today (which is precisely why we are working so hard on
  building out
  <a href="https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth1"
    >our execution layer client</a
  >).

<h3 id="interop-lock-in-round-2">Interop lock in: round 2</h3>
<p>
  In the <a href="https://t.co/97X85jdCzM?amp=1">words of Ben Edgington</a>, the
  cat is out of the bag - the eth1 and eth2 client teams will be meeting up in
  early October to get some Merge devnets running.
</p>
<p>
  You can think of this as round 2 of the interop event we did two years ago.
</p>
<p>
  Expect to hear a lot of updates from the client teams as we build out the
  Merge logic and test our software together on short-lived devnets.
</p>
<p>
  In anticipation, we'll leave you with some highlights from the previous
  lockin.
